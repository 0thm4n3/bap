Flag frontend
  Description: Build BAP frontend
  Default: false

# !!!! READ THE FOLLOWING NOTE !!!
# Frontends that are capable of loading plugins, aka hosts
# programs, can only depend on the two internal libraries:
# bap and bap.plugins. They may, however, depend on an arbitrary
# amount of findlib libraries.
# The internal library is a library declared with the Library section
# in the _oasis file.
# Clarification. We use `findlib.dynload` to track libraries, with which
# a binary is linked. Unfortunately, internal libraries bypass this mechanism
# so if some plugin will try to load the same internal library, then it
# will be loaded as dependency, that will lead to a corruption and
# hopefully to a segfault.
# If your frontend needs some internal library, then consider moving
# the functionality that needs this into a plugin, as frontends are intended
# only for parsing command-line arguments and dispatching them to bap.
